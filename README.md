# Breaking Changes
I have re-written most of the plugin so in case you need to stay in an old version use the tagged version `v2.2.1` and not master.

# Laravel.nvim
Plugin for Neovim to enhance the development experience of Laravel projects

Quick executing of artisan commands, list and navigate to routes. Information about the routes.
Robust API to allow you to run any command in the way that you need.

# Requirements
Treesitter, LSP Server (I use and recommend [phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor))

# Installation
Lazy
```lua
return {
  "adalessa/laravel.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    "tpope/vim-dotenv",
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
  },
  cmd = { "Sail", "Artisan", "Composer", "Npm", "Yarn", "Laravel" },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>la", ":Laravel artisan<cr>" },
    { "<leader>lr", ":Laravel routes<cr>" },
    {
      "<leader>lt",
      function()
        require("laravel.tinker").send_to_tinker()
      end,
      mode = "v",
      desc = "Laravel Application Routes",
    },
  },
  event = { "VeryLazy" },
  config = function()
    require("laravel").setup()
    require("telescope").load_extension "laravel"
  end,
}
```

Dotenv is use to read environment variables from the `.env` file

For nicer notifications use `rcarriga/nvim-notify`
My lazy configuration for notify is
```lua
return {
    "rcarriga/nvim-notify",
    config = function()
        local notify = require("notify")
        -- this for transparency
        notify.setup({ background_colour = "#000000" })
        -- this overwrites the vim notify function
        vim.notify = notify.notify
    end
}
```

## Environments
There are many ways to run your laravel application, could be natively in you computer, using docker-compose, using sail, or others.
Even using docker-compose you could have differences from project to project.
In order to support this there is an `environment` configuration. Here you can set 2 properties.
`resolver` takes care of determining which environment to use.
The resolver will return the environment to use. The resolver will first look for an environment variable `NVIM_LARAVEL_ENV` which should correspond to configured environment name.
If is not set it will be ignored, if it is set but could not be found an error will be thrown.
Next is the auto auto-discovery this will look for docker-compose file and Sail file in the vendor directory. If they are present Sail will be used.
If only docker-compose.yml file is present docker-compose environment will be used.
If both checks fail will check if the php is executable and then local environment will be used.
The third part is try to use the provided default.
You can configure the resolver by passing parameters
```lua
---@param env_check boolean
---@param auto_discovery boolean
---@param default string|nil
return function(env_check, auto_discovery, default)
```
Resolver can be configured to ignore environment variable, ignore auto-discovery and just use the default
```lua
    resolver = require "laravel.environment.resolver"(false, false, "sail"),
```

The environment needs to return a function that returns a list of executables in format of a table. This will be used when running the `run` method on the application `require('laravel.application').run('<command>', {"args"}, {options})`
Let say you want to modify the Sail command, you can do it by calling the setup method on the environment Sail with options cmd
```lua
      ["sail"] = require("laravel.environment.sail").setup({cmd = {"my-sail-binary"}}),
```
You can set different commands for normal executables, or completely replace all the executables.
If you add your executable you can call it using
`require('laravel.application).run('executable', args, options)`

Changing the container name for docker compose
```lua
    require("laravel").setup({
      environment = {
        environments = {
          ["docker-compose"] = require("laravel.environment.docker_compose").setup({container_name = "testing"}),
        }
      }
    })
```


## Artisan
To run Artisan commands you can use `:Artisan` which will autocomplete with the available
artisan command as the terminal

Not sending any arguments will run the Telescope prompt

`:Artisan tinker` will open the terminal inside of Neovim, with tinker

Any other command will just run and output the result on a new split

## Sail
You can run `shell` as tinker will open a new terminal
`up`, `down`, `restart` will notify when starting and result will show as notification

## Composer
`install`, `update`, `require` and `remove` from the `:Composer` command

## Plugin specific
`Laravel cache:clear` purge the cache clears the cache for commands.
`Laravel commands` shows the list of artisan commands and executes it.
`Laravel routes` show the list of routes and goes to the implementation.
`Laravel test` runs the application tests
`Laravel test:watch` runs the application tests and keep monitoring the changes

# Route Info
I want to have more information in the controller, I want to have the route information directly in the controller so I build route info, this will show the
![](./images/route_info.png)
This also will show error if a route is defined but the method is not defined
![](./images/missing_method.png)

> Note: using lazy is likely that you will not see at first since the plugin will not load until you call one of the commands, after that it is just picked up

## Lua API
As developer I want to enable other to extend this plugin to cover all your needs. For this I tried to have a good API.

To run artisan commands you can execute
```lua
require('laravel.application').run('artisan', {'your-command'}, {})
```
That is great but what about how to get the results not all commands behave in the same way.
Currently there are several runners:

| Runner   | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                         |
| buffer   | This opens an split and shows the results in a new buffer. This uses the `vim.fn.jobstart` to run the command                                            |
| sync     | This is more for api since the result of the command will be directly return to work with                                                                |
| async    | Similar to `sync` but it takes a callback and will call it once the data is loaded, usefull for long process and to not block the editor                 |
| persist  | One thing with buffers is that are temprary once you close the buffer the job is terminated, for some process you don't want that like, npm dev or other |
| watch    | This is usefull for commands that needs to be retrigger one files are modifed, like queues restart, or tests                                             |


So you can run commands like
```lua
require('laravel.application').run('artisan', {'your-command'}, {runner = 'persist'})
```
Each runner returns different values since it have different behave.

| Runner   | Output                 |
| --       | --                     |
| buffer   | {buff, job}            |
| sync     | {out, exit_code, err } |
| async    | {}                     |
| persist  | {buff, job}            |
| watch    | {buff, job}            |


These runners are available for the following commands
- artisan
- composer
- sail
- npm
- yarn

This is to provide the option to you to build what ever you need for you development experience.

The commands have a default runner configure that you can customize
```lua
    default_runner = "buffer",
    commands_runner = {
        ["dump-server"] = "persist",
        ["queue:listen"] = "persist",
        ["serve"] = "persist",
        ["websockets"] = "persist",
        ["queue:restart"] = "watch",
    },
```


## Send to Tinker
Working with laravel tinker is a great tool so after thinking how can improve my flow with it I decide that selecting lines and have them send to tinker it was a good idea
So that is exactly what I did with the function `require("laravel.tinker").send_to_tinker()` which will grab the selected lines and send them to the open tinker or open a new one if is not already.
If you copy my keybindings from lazy or you can assign to your like is great.



### Improve your flow.
Is normal that working with a project you have several things that you would like to start automatically.
Lets say for example that you would like to have two windows, one with the test running with every change of file and other with the dump server
we can write this
```lua
local function start()
  vim.cmd "vsplit new"
  local top = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
  local width = vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0)
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_width(0, vim.fn.round(width * 2 / 3))
  vim.cmd "split new"
  local bot = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()

  local test_run = require("laravel.application").run('artisan', { "test" }, "watch", { open = false })
  local dump_run = require("laravel.application").run('artisan', { "dump-server" }, "persist", { open = false })

  vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(top, test_run.buff)
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(bot, dump_run.buff)
end
```
The function will create an split, and resize it, split again and with these 2 windows will call the commands that want. Since in this case we want to set the position our self we send the option to not open.
After that we only need to set the buffer from the commands into the windows and ready.


Other example to just run everything
```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("StartMyApp", function ()
  require('laravel.application').run('artisan', {"serve"})
  require('laravel.application').run('artisan', {"queue:restart"})
  require('laravel.application').run('artisan', {"queue:listen"})
  require('laravel.application').run('yarn', {"dev"}, "persist")
end, {})
```
This will create your own command and when run will just call everyone of the commands, and split the windows as it needs and you resize when you want. Remember the `open = false` is an option to not have it display and run in the background.

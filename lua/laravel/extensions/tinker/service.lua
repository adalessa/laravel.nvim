local tinker = {}


-- should be able to handle multiple .tinker files in the directory
-- should have the history of the output for each

-- a better auto dump to print the output

-- an idea can be how the scrat buffer handles it, a selector for the files
-- open a selector, use vim.ui.select from simplicity
-- this will open the window, which will be a popup 70 % of the screen
-- which the editor should be 70% and 30% for the ouput

-- the results should be store separetly so can be re-written for each different option.
-- the ui should not be for ever, when quits it's unmount, not keept in memory
